**A prep tool for your text-based recipes**

`sift` is a text extraction tool for the command line. Use its search to pinpoint relevant information, or simply extract clean, structured content from URLs, files, or stdin. It's a composable tool for building data pipelines for your LLM workflows

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Smart Content Extraction:** Automatically removes HTML, ads, and boilerplate to isolate the main content using Mozilla's Readability algorithm. You can also target specific elements with CSS selectors.

- **Field-Aware Search:** Pinpoint relevant information with a keyword search  that understands document structure.

- **Flexible I/O:** Process content from URLs, local files, or standard input with automatic source detection. Output formats include Markdown, plain text, or JSON.

- **Precise Output Sizing:** Control output size with token-level precision for LLM workflows, using the `cl100k_base` tokenizer, or by word and character counts.

- **Composable by Design:** Built as a native command-line tool, so you can easily pipe content in and chain with other tools to create powerful text processing workflows.

## Installation

### From Release Binaries

You can download a pre-compiled binary for your operating system from [latest releases](https://github.com/chriscorrea/sift/releases).

### Go Install
If you have a Go environment set up, you can install `sift` directly:
```bash
go install github.com/chriscorrea/sift/cmd/sift@latest
```

## Quick Start

Sift the main content from a webpage:

```bash
sift https://www.recipetineats.com/carrot-cake/
```

Target specific content with CSS selectors:

```bash
sift https://www.recipetineats.com/carrot-cake/ --selector ".wprm-recipe"
```

Find the most relevant content using keyword search (and limit to 200 tokens):
```bash
sift https://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/64onedim/odmintro.html --search "technology" -t 200
```

Chain with other command line tools, such as [slop for LLMs](https://github.com/chriscorrea/slop):
```bash
sift https://www.recipetineats.com/carrot-cake/ | \
slop --yaml "build a shopping list, organized by aisle"
```
